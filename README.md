# pywe
## The python-based (and completely useless) weather app by ProbitJK

Join me in a journey where I have my many firsts- python package, cli tool and most importantly, my first personal **project**.

Watch me as I use my big brain and fail to use OpenWeatherMap's simple API while being broke enough to only use the free services. If you too wish to undertake such foolish adventures instead of downloading an app then rush off to [this site](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your very own API key for free!

I have no idea why I am doing this but I will be following the basic ideas of Semantic Versioning system which gives the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format of version number. For more info see [here](https://semver.org)

Layout (This is the planned structure of the project, not what it will eventually turn out to be):
pywe/
|
|- pywe/
|   |- __init__.py
|   |- __main__.py
|   |- cli.py
|   |- config.py
|   |- pywe.py
|   |_ api.key (**Not to be included in the git repository**)
|
|- README.md
|
|_ requirements.txt
